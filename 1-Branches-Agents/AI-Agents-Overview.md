# AI Agents

### One-Liner:
*   **What it is:** An AI system that can perceive its environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals autonomously.

### The Big Picture:
AI Agents represent a **paradigm shift** from AI as a passive tool to AI as an active participant. They don't just answer questions or generate text; they *perform multi-step tasks* by using tools, reasoning, and learning from feedback.

### How it Works (The Core Idea):
An agent typically follows a loop:
1.  **Perceive:** Take in information from the environment (e.g., a user's request, a webpage, a database).
2.  **Plan:** Reason about the goal and break it down into steps.
3.  **Act:** Use tools (like a calculator, web browser, or API) to execute a step.
4.  **Observe:** See the result of the action and repeat the loop until the goal is achieved.

### Why it Matters:
They automate complex workflows that require intelligence and adaptability. They are the foundation for creating truly autonomous systems, from customer service bots that can actually solve problems to AI scientists that can run experiments.

### A Simple Analogy:
**Hiring a personal assistant.**
*   **A simple AI chatbot** is like asking a know-it-all friend a trivia question.
*   **An AI Agent** is like hiring a personal assistant: you give them a complex goal ("Plan my vacation to Japan"). They will autonomously research flights, check hotel availability, book tickets, and create an itinerary for you, reporting back when it's done.

### Real-World Examples:
*   An agent that can **book a flight** by searching the web, comparing prices, and filling out forms.
*   A **coding agent** that can understand a bug report, analyze the code, write a fix, and test it.
*   A **research agent** that can read scientific papers, summarize findings, and generate new hypotheses.
