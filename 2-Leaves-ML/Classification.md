# Classification

### One-Liner:
*   **What it is:** A type of supervised learning where the goal is to predict a discrete category or label.

### The Big Picture:
Classification is one of the two classic **leaves** on the **Supervised Learning** branch (the other being Regression). It's used for tasks where the answer is a choice from a fixed set of options.

### How it Works (The Core Idea):
A classification algorithm learns from a labeled dataset where the outcomes are categories. It learns the patterns that distinguish each category and builds a model that can assign a new, unseen data point to the most probable category.

### Why it Matters:
It solves a huge range of practical problems where the answer is a "what" or a "which," not a "how much."

### A Simple Analogy:
A sorting hat from Harry Potter.
*   **Input:** A student (data point).
*   **Output:** A house â€” Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, or Slytherin (the discrete label).
The hat (the model) has learned the patterns of each house and makes a classification decision.

### Real-World Examples:
*   **Spam Filtering:** Classifying an email as "spam" or "not spam".
*   **Medical Diagnosis:** Classifying an X-ray image as "pneumonia" or "normal".
*   **Sentiment Analysis:** Classifying a tweet as "positive", "negative", or "neutral".
