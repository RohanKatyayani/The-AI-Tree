# Regression

### One-Liner:
*   **What it is:** A type of supervised learning where the goal is to predict a continuous numerical value.

### The Big Picture:
Regression is the second classic **leaf** on the **Supervised Learning** branch (the other being Classification). It's used for tasks where the answer is a quantity, a number, or an amount.

### How it Works (The Core Idea):
A regression algorithm learns from a labeled dataset where the outcomes are numbers. It learns the relationship between the input features and this continuous output, essentially fitting a line (or curve) to the data points. It then uses this line to predict a value for new data.

### Why it Matters:
It solves problems where we need to forecast or estimate a numerical outcome, which is crucial in fields like finance, economics, and science.

### A Simple Analogy:
Predicting the price of a house.
*   **Input:** Features of the house like size, location, number of bedrooms.
*   **Output:** The predicted price (a continuous number, e.g., $499,567.89).
It's not about choosing a category ("cheap", "expensive"), but predicting the exact dollar amount.

### Real-World Examples:
*   **Predicting House Prices:** Based on features like square footage and zip code.
*   **Forecasting Stock Prices:** Predicting the future value of a stock.
*   **Estimating Crop Yield:** Predicting the number of bushels per acre.
