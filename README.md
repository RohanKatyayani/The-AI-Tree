# The AI Tree üå±

Welcome to **The AI Tree**, a project to map the entire world of Artificial Intelligence, one simple concept at a time.

## The Goal

AI can be overwhelming. This repository aims to be a **public, living glossary** that explains any AI concept in the simplest terms possible, using analogies and clear examples. It's built for learners, by a learner.

> **"The best way to learn is to teach."** This project is my journey to understand AI from the ground up.

## How This Tree Grows

*   **Roots (`/0-Roots`)**: The foundational ideas. What is AI, ML, NLP, etc.? Start here.
*   **Branches (`/1-Branches-*`)**: The main sub-fields that grow out of the roots.
*   **Leaves (`/2-Leaves-*`)**: Specific algorithms, models, and techniques‚Äîthe details that make up the branches.
*   **Resources (`/Resources`)**: A collection of research papers, articles, and links for deeper diving.

## The Philosophy

Every concept is explained in a standard format:
*   **One-Liner:** A single-sentence definition.
*   **The Big Picture:** Where it fits into the larger AI world.
*   **How it Works:** The core idea broken down.
*   **A Simple Analogy:** A relatable, day-to-day comparison.
*   **Why it Matters:** Its real-world importance.
*   **Examples:** Concrete use cases.

## Join the Journey

This is a work in progress, growing steadily.
*   **Started:** September 1st, 2025.
*   **Goal:** +20 concepts explained in September 2025.

This is not meant to be an exhaustive textbook but a curated learning path. Suggestions and contributions are welcome!
