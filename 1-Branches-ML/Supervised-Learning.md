# Supervised Learning

### One-Liner:
*   **What it is:** Machine Learning where the model learns from **labeled** data. It's like learning with a teacher or an answer key.

### The Big Picture:
This is the first and most common **branch** on the **Machine Learning** tree. It's used for tasks where we know the right answer beforehand and want to teach the computer to predict it for new data.

### How it Works (The Core Idea):
You give the algorithm a dataset where each example has two parts:
1.  **Input:** The data (e.g., a picture of an animal).
2.  **Label:** The correct output (e.g., "cat" or "dog").
The algorithm learns to map the inputs to the outputs, building a model that can predict the label for new, unseen input.

### Why it Matters:
It solves two of the most common types of problems: **Classification** (putting things into categories) and **Regression** (predicting a continuous value).

### A Simple Analogy:
It's like using flashcards to study for a test. The question on the front is the **input**, and the answer on the back is the **label**. By going through the deck again and again, you learn the pattern and can answer new questions on the actual test.

### Real-World Examples:
*   **Classification:** Spam filter (input: email, label: "spam" or "not spam").
*   **Regression:** Predicting house prices (input: house size, location, etc., label: the price).
