# Early Stopping

### One-Liner:
*   **What it is:** A regularization technique that stops the training process when the model's performance on a validation set stops improving, preventing overfitting.

### The Big Picture:
Early Stopping is the **wise timeout** in model training. It recognizes when further training is no longer helping generalization and might actually be harming it by making the model too specialized to the training data.

### How it Works (The Core Idea):
During training, you monitor the model's performance on a validation set (not the training set). When the validation performance stops improving for a predefined number of epochs ("patience"), training is automatically stopped, and the best model weights are restored.

### Why it Matters:
It's one of the simplest yet most effective regularization techniques. It saves computation time and prevents the model from memorizing noise in the training data.

### A Simple Analogy:
**Baking a cake and using a toothpick test.**
*   You keep baking and periodically testing with a toothpick.
*   When the toothpick comes out clean, you stop baking immediately.
*   If you kept baking beyond that point, the cake would become dry and burnt (overfitted).
*   Early Stopping is that "toothpick test" for machine learning.

### Real-World Examples:
*   **Neural network training** where you stop when validation loss plateaus.
*   **Gradient boosting** models that use early stopping to determine the optimal number of trees.
*   **Hyperparameter tuning** where early stopping saves computational resources.
