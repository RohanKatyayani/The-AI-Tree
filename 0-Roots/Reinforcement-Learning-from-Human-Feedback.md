# Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)

### One-Liner:
*   **What it is:** A training technique that uses human preferences as a reward signal to fine-tune AI models, making them more helpful, honest, and harmless.

### The Big Picture:
RLHF is the **alignment engine** that bridges the gap between raw AI capabilities and human values. It's what transforms a powerful but potentially misaligned base model into a helpful assistant that understands what humans actually want.

### How it Works (The Core Idea):
The process typically involves three key steps:
1.  **Supervised Fine-Tuning:** Train on high-quality human demonstrations.
2.  **Reward Model Training:** Train a separate model to predict human preferences between different responses.
3.  **Reinforcement Learning:** Use the reward model to provide feedback and fine-tune the main model using algorithms like PPO.

### Why it Matters:
It allows us to train AI systems that are not just competent but also aligned with complex human values that are difficult to specify with simple rules or loss functions.

### A Simple Analogy:
**Training a talented but clueless intern.**
*   **Step 1:** Show them examples of good work (Supervised Fine-Tuning).
*   **Step 2:** Teach them to recognize what you like by having them predict your preferences between different work samples (Reward Model).
*   **Step 3:** Let them do work and give feedback based on those learned preferences (RL Fine-tuning).
*   Result: An intern who not only has skills but understands your taste and standards.

### Real-World Examples:
*   **ChatGPT's** conversational alignment came largely from RLHF.
*   **Anthropic's Claude** used constitutional AI, an extension of RLHF principles.
*   **AI assistants** that learn to avoid harmful, biased, or unhelpful responses.
