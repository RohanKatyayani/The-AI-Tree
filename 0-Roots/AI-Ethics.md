# AI Ethics

### One-Liner:
*   **What it is:** A set of moral principles and techniques intended to inform the development and use of artificial intelligence technologies for the good of humanity.

### The Big Picture:
AI Ethics is the **conscience** of the entire AI field. It's the overarching framework that guides us to ask not just "Can we build it?" but "Should we build it?" and "How can we build it responsibly?" It encompasses fairness, transparency, accountability, and more.

### How it Works (The Core Idea):
It involves applying ethical thinking to the entire AI lifecycle:
*   **Design:** Considering potential misuse and unintended consequences from the start.
*   **Development:** Implementing practices for [[Fairness in AI]], transparency, and privacy.
*   **Deployment:** Ensuring human oversight and accountability for decisions.

### Why it Matters:
AI systems have immense power to impact lives, economies, and societies. Without a strong ethical foundation, they risk causing widespread harm, eroding trust, and creating a future we don't want to live in.

### A Simple Analogy:
**The rules of the road for drivers.**
*   **AI Technology:** is like a powerful, high-speed car.
*   **AI Ethics:** are the traffic laws, driver's education, and social norms that prevent crashes and ensure the car is used to get people to their destinations safely, not to cause chaos.
*   Without ethics, it's just a dangerous weapon or tool for chaos.

### Real-World Examples:
*   **Creating review boards** for AI projects, similar to those used in medical research.
*   **Establishing principles** like "human-in-the-loop" for critical decisions.
*   **Developing regulations** like the EU AI Act that classify AI systems by risk and set requirements.
*   **Companies pledging** not to develop autonomous weapons.
