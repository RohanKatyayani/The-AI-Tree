# Constitutional AI

### One-Liner:
*   **What it is:** A framework for training AI systems to govern their own behavior according to a set of principles or a "constitution," reducing the need for extensive human feedback.

### The Big Picture:
Constitutional AI is an **evolution beyond RLHF** that aims to create more scalable and principled AI alignment. Instead of learning preferences from individual human raters, the model learns to critique and revise its own responses based on fundamental principles.

### How it Works (The Core Idea):
The process involves:
1.  **Supervised Learning:** Train on examples of AI responses being critiqued and revised according to constitutional principles.
2.  **Reinforcement Learning:** The model learns to generate, critique, and revise its own responses based on the constitution, with minimal human intervention.

### Why it Matters:
It provides a more scalable approach to AI safety by encoding values into principles rather than learning from countless individual human preferences. It also makes the AI's values more transparent and auditable.

### A Simple Analogy:
**Teaching someone to be ethical using principles vs. case-by-case correction.**
*   **RLHF:** Correcting someone every time they make a questionable decision.
*   **Constitutional AI:** Giving them a moral compass (the constitution) and teaching them to self-reflect: "Does this action align with my principles? How can I improve it?"
*   The goal is to create someone who internalizes ethics rather than just following orders.

### Real-World Examples:
*   **Anthropic's Claude** was trained using Constitutional AI principles.
*   **AI systems** that can explain why certain responses violate safety principles.
*   **Transparent AI** where the governing principles are explicitly stated and auditable.

*ðŸŒ³ **Parent Concept:** An advanced approach to **AI Alignment**.
*ðŸ“œ **The Core Idea:** **Self-governance** through explicit principles.
*ðŸš€ **The Advantage:** More **scalable** and **transparent** than pure RLHF.
*ðŸ”— **Related To:** [[Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback]] but with a different approach.
