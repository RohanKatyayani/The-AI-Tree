# Federated Learning

### One-Liner:
*   **What it is:** A distributed machine learning approach that trains models across multiple decentralized devices or servers holding local data samples, without exchanging the data itself.

### The Big Picture:
Federated Learning is the **privacy-preserving revolution** in AI. Instead of bringing all data to one central server, it brings the model to the data, trains locally, and only shares model updates.

### How it Works (The Core Idea):
1.  **Central Server** sends the global model to devices
2.  **Devices** train the model on their local data
3.  **Only model updates** (not raw data) are sent back to server
4.  **Server aggregates** updates from many devices to improve global model
5.  **Repeat** the process

### Why it Matters:
It enables training on sensitive data while preserving privacy, reduces bandwidth usage, and allows for personalized models without data leaving user devices.

### A Simple Analogy:
**A cooking competition where recipes improve without sharing secret ingredients.**
*   **Traditional ML:** All chefs bring their secret ingredients to one kitchen (data centralization).
*   **Federated Learning:** Each chef keeps ingredients secret, but shares cooking technique improvements. A master chef collects these improvements to create a better recipe, without ever knowing the secret ingredients.

### Real-World Examples:
*   **Google Keyboard** (Gboard) learning next-word predictions from your typing without sending your messages to the cloud.
*   **Healthcare** models trained across multiple hospitals without sharing patient data.
*   **Mobile apps** that personalize without compromising user privacy.
