# Model Monitoring

### One-Liner:
*   **What it is:** The practice of continuously tracking a deployed model's performance and behavior in production to ensure it remains accurate, fair, and reliable over time.

### The Big Picture:
Model Monitoring is the **guardian** of the MLOps branch. It's the essential process of keeping a watchful eye on live models to catch problems before they cause damage. Deployment is not the finish line; it's the starting line for monitoring.

### How it Works (The Core Idea):
Key metrics are continuously tracked, such as:
*   **Prediction Drift:** Are the model's incoming input data patterns changing?
*   **Concept Drift:** Is the relationship between the input and the target variable changing?
*   **Performance Metrics:** Is the model's accuracy, latency, or error rate degrading?
Alerts are triggered if these metrics cross a predefined threshold.

### Why it Matters:
The real world is constantly changing. A model that was accurate last month can become outdated and harmful this month. Monitoring is what prevents this silent failure.

### A Simple Analogy:
**Performing regular health check-ups on a person.**
*   **Deployment:** Is like the person starting a new job.
*   **Monitoring:** Is like going to the doctor for annual check-ups, getting blood tests, and wearing a fitness tracker. It ensures they stay healthy and catch any issues (high blood pressure, illness) early, before they become a crisis.

### Real-World Examples:
*   A **credit scoring model** is monitored to ensure it doesn't suddenly start denying loans to a certain demographic.
*   An **e-commerce recommendation model** is watched for a drop in click-through rate, indicating it's becoming less relevant.
*   A **self-driving car's vision model** is monitored for increased error rates in certain weather conditions.
